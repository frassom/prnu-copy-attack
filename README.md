# Python variance-based fingerprint-copy attack

Python implementation of the PRNU extraction methods described in [1], PRNU detection based on PCE, and the Triangle Test as described in [2].

## Test
`python test` from the repository root.

## Credits
This repository uses the PRNU extraction code implemented in https://github.com/polimi-ispl/prnu-python, that is a python port of [the MATLAB implementation by Binghamton University](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/).
