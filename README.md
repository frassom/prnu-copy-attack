# Python variance-based fingerprint-copy attack

Python implementation of the methods described in [Barni et al. "Countering the Pooled Triangle Test for PRNU-based camera identification"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8630778).

## Requirements
```
numpy
pillow
matplotlib
scikit-learn
scipy
pywavelets
tqdm
```

## Credits
This repository uses the prnu-noise extraction code implemented in https://github.com/polimi-ispl/prnu-python, that is a python port of [the MATLAB implementation by Binghamton University](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/).
