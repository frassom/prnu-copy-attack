# Python variance-based fingerprint-copy attack

Python implementation of the methods described in [M. Barni, M. Nakano-Miyatake, H. Santoyo-Garc√¨a and B. Tondi, "Countering the Pooled Triangle Test for PRNU-based camera identification,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8630778).

## Credits
This repository uses the PRNU extraction code implemented in https://github.com/polimi-ispl/prnu-python, that is a python port of [the MATLAB implementation by Binghamton University](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/).
